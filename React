React.js is a javascript API that uses JSX elements to allow scripting in an integrated manner.
JSX is a syntax extension of JS that creates DOM elements rendered by the React DOM as HTML. It compiles to javascript before running on a web browser.
  import React from 'react';
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
  
  ReactDOM.render(
    <h1 id='element'>This is an element.</h1>,
    document.getElementById('app')
  ); //appends h1 element to app html file
  
  const element1 = (
    <ul>
      <li>item 1</li>
      <li>item 2</li>
    </ul>
  );
